                <p>
                    One of my hobbies is chess, when I was on high school, chess was part of my daily life,
                    but now, isn't another thing but my hobby.

                <h5>Game developtment</h5>
                <p>
                    Another of my hobbies, is to code games, in my major plan, there is a class called "Game developtment",
                    that one didn't reach my espectatives about game developtment, in my side, I've been trying to make 
                    this on my free time(I've not finished any of them yet).

                <h5>Arcane</h5>
                <p>
                    Arcane is a really good serie I recommend this, is based in a really famous game,
                    the best part of this, is that you don't need to play the game to understand 
                    the world and its people.

                <h5>Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World</h5>
                <p>
                    I've watched Re:zero at least 10 times. This serie has almost the pefect plot,
                    I love series when characters talk and talk and talk and talk istead of having fights or
                    are a lot of action scenes.
